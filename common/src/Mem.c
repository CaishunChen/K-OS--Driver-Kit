    COSMIC
    ========
   The default _sbreak function provided by the library is as follows:
   //  SET SYSTEM BREAK

   void *sbreak(int size)
   {
   extern char _memory;
   static char *_brk = NULL	//  memory break
   char *obrk, yellow[40];
   if (!_brk)   // initialize on first call
   _brk = &_memory;
   obrk = _brk; // old top
   _brk += size; // new top
   if (yellow <= _brk || _brk < &_memory)
   {	//  check boundaries
   _brk = obrk;	// restore old top
   return (NULL);   // return NULL pointer
   }
   return (obrk); // return new area start
   }

   The yellow array is used to calculate the stack pointer value to check the
   heap limits. This array is declared as the last local variable, so its
   address is almost equal to the stack pointer once the function has been
   entered. It is declared to be 40 bytes wide to allow for some security
   margin. If the new top is outside the authorized limits, the function
   returns a NULL pointer, otherwise, it returns the start of the new allocated
   area. Note that the top variable _brk is a static variable initialized
   to zero (NULL pointer). It is set to the heap start on the first call. It is
   also possible to initialize it directly within the declaration, but in this
   case, we create an initialized variable in the data segment which needs
   to be initialized by the startup. The current code avoids such a requirement
   by initializing the variable to zero (in the bss segment), which is
   simply done by the standard startup sequence.
